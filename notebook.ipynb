      "These are just a few examples, but there are countless other delicious Indian dishes to explore. Let me know if you need a specific recipe or if you have any questions about cooking Indian food!For the Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani), you can replace the chicken with paneer, a type of Indian cottage cheese. To prepare the paneer, you can cut it into cubes and marinate it in a mixture of yogurt, ginger, garlic, and a blend of Indian spices such as garam masala and turmeric. Then, you can grill or pan-fry the marinated paneer until it's golden brown and has a slightly crispy exterior.\n",

      "For the Chicken Tikka Masala, you can use the same marinated and grilled paneer as a substitute for the chicken. The creamy tomato sauce and aromatic spices will complement the paneer beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Vegetable Biryani, you can simply omit the meat and increase the quantity of mixed vegetables. You can use a variety of vegetables such as carrots, peas, cauliflower, and potatoes to create a colorful and flavorful biryani. Additionally, you can add some marinated and grilled paneer to enhance the dish with a protein element.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Palak Paneer, you can follow the traditional recipe for the creamy spinach curry and simply add more paneer to make it a more substantial dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, I don't know of a direct substitute for chicken in Chana Masala, as the dish is centered around chickpeas. However, you can enhance the flavor by adding more aromatic spices and adjusting the seasoning to your taste.\n",
